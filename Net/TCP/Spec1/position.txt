For the moment, we are writing a spec that is loose enough to include
BSD, but not too much looser than that.



We also seem to be including a number of baroquenesses from BSD that
will make white-box testing easier if we include them... ??  But not
always (cf rcv_adv, requested_s_scale).



Aiming to describe behaviour in response to *any* incoming segment,
not just those generated by "good" TCPs.



We're *NOT* writing a conformance spec for RFC1122 or anything like
that; BSD clearly fails in a number of places here.



(We're also noting down (but not speccing) places where BSD seems
clearly weird or wrong.)
