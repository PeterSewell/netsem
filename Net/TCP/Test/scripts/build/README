This directory (/usr/groups/tthee/local/) contains the binaries etc
used for the distributed trace checking exercise.

Please do not modify without checking with Keith Wansbrough, Peter
Sewell, or Steve Bishop.

DIRECTORIES
~~~~~~~~~~~

hol98-src/ contains the source of the latest version of HOL98, checked
out from SourceForge at http://hol.sourceforge.net/.

hol98-local/ contains any local changes to the hol98 sources - any
files in this tree will override any in the hol98-src tree.  At
present, this tree is empty.

hol98/ contains the build of the latest version of HOL98.  This build
tree contains symlinks to every file in hol98-src and/or hol98-local
(the latter overriding the former), and locally contains all object
files, executables, and other generated files.  The idea is that you
can blow everything away and rebuild simply by doing rm -rf hol98/ and
then relinking it, without having to check the sources out again.  If
desired, the build tree could also live on an unbacked-up filesystem
(although it does not at present).  It also allows multiple build
trees to share the same sources.


Net-src/ contains the source of all the TCP project stuff, checked out
from our repository at /usr/groups/netsem/cvs/.

Net-local/ contains any local changes; it is empty.

Net/ contains the build tree for the TCP project spec and tools.

Net-alt/ contains another build tree; we sometimes alternate build
trees so as not to disturb a check run in progress.



======================================================================

SCRIPTS
~~~~~~~

This directory also contains a bunch of scripts for maintaining this
structure and (re)building HOL and the spec and tools.  These all
actually live in Net-src/TCP/Test/scripts/build/, and are symlinked
here.

The only exception is waprc, the configuration file for all of the
scripts.  It contains

  # machine-specific configuration file for WAP building tools
  # (generic NFS-mount version)

  HOLSRC=/usr/groups/tthee/local/hol98-src
  HOLLOC=/usr/groups/tthee/local/hol98-local
  HOLDIR=/usr/groups/tthee/local/hol98

  WAPSRC=/usr/groups/tthee/local/Net-src
  WAPLOC=/usr/groups/tthee/local/Net-local
  # WAPDIR=/usr/groups/tthee/local/Net
  WAPDIR=/usr/groups/tthee/local/Net-alt

This just specifies the names of each of the directories described
above.  Note in particular that altering WAPDIR to point to Net-alt/
rather than Net/ enables building a fresh spec without touching the
existing one, which may be in use by a current check run.  Then
copying CheckTraces.exe across is sufficient for use in a new run.

(there's an example waprc, called waprc.tpl, in TCP/Test/scripts/build/).


== updatewap / updatewap-noclean

Checks out the latest Net-src/ stuff from the repository, relinks
(using relinkwap), cleans and remakes in TCP/Spec1/.  This is all you
need to upgrade to a newer version of the spec.

The -noclean variant doesn't do a Holmake clean in the Spec1 dir
first.  This is usually a bad idea, since often the build will almost
complete and then discover some incompatibility that means you have to
throw it all away.


== updatehol

Checks out the latest hol98-src/ stuff from the repository, relinks
(using relinkhol98), reconfigures (using doconfig), and rebuilds
(using dobuild).  This is all you need to upgrade to a newer version
of HOL.


== doconfig / dobuild

Reconfigures / builds HOL.  Called by updatehol.


== relinkhol98 / relinkwap

Relinks the build directory to the source directories.


== fixperms

Sets the permissions correctly in all the directories below here.

INSTALLATION LOG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(may be out of date!)

# Note that the technique used in these notes is that of a build tree
# / source tree separation.  The sources are not touched during
# compilation, and at any time the build tree can be blown away with
# rm -rf * without touching the sources.  Note that the relink command
# must be run reasonably regularly to deal with the case where files
# are added or removed in the source tree.
