This directory contains shell scripts to generally make life easier
:-)

build-diags
~~~~~~~~~~~

builds the tracennnn.ps.gz views of the trace.  Documentation in file.
Note that only running it in the relevant dir works - passing a dir on
the command line is broken at the moment.

build-diags3
~~~~~~~~~~~~

builds the tracennnn.annotated.ps.gz views of the trace - with the
rule firings down one side.  Documentation in file.

check/:
~~~~~~~
Directory contains the distributed HOL trace checking code. See
check/README for further details.

distribute:
~~~~~~~~~~~
This packages the local version of the Net/TCP/Test/
directory tree into a gzipped tarball and securely copies it to each
non-Windows machine on our test network: alan, kurt, emil and john.

Connecting via ssh it unpackages the directory on each host into
/home/Net/TCP/Test and proceeds to call make at the top
level. Distribute connects to the test machine as root, so you must
have root access via private-key ssh.

Finally, for tools that require extra privileges, it changes their
ownership to user root and group wheel, and sets their setuid bit.

It should be called from /home/Net/TCP/Test by executing
script/distribute.

To make life simpler, OCaml lives in the same place on the subnet
machines as on the lab machines: /usr/groups/netsem/ocaml/.  For the
script to work without manual intervention, RSA key authentication
must be setup for ssh connections to the machines on the test network.

bsd-script, linux-script:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
are dependencies of distribute for the respective architectures.

win/
~~~~
The scripts in this directory are used ON a windows machine to
distribute the test tools to that machine (this is the Windows
equivalent of distribute, except that it pulls rather than pushes the
update). See Section 6, "Distributing the test tools to the test
machines" in Test/README for further details on how to use these.

build/:
~~~~~~~
Directory contains useful scripts for maintaining the structure of
/usr/groups/tthee/local which has source and build directories for
both the test tools and hol98. See build/README for details.

packagetsc:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Packages up the Windows timer calibration code in utils/tsccal for
distribution to the outside world.

lintperm:
~~~~~~~~~
A script for checking the permissions in /usr/groups/tthee and
/usr/groups/tthee-scratch are correct.... because people have a bad
habbit of screwing up file permissions in this group shared
directories!
