Usage: ./dlhack application application_args

Start the application with the specified arguments but with its socket calls dynamically relinked to go through our instrumented sockets library in order to produce a trace of the applications behaviour.

Effectively you get:

    Application (e.g. Mozilla)
   -------------
   socket_preload
   -------------
      nssock
   -------------
      glibc

See Test/dynamic for information on the socket_preload library and look at the dlhack script here for insight to what is going on and how it works.

`man dlopen` will be of assistance in understanding how all this works.
