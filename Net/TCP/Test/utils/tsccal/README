TSCcal
~~~~~~

This Win32 console application calibrates the IA32 timestamp counter
register accessed by the RDTSC instruction.  It uses
GetSystemTimeAsFileTime as a time reference, assuming that it is
correct if invoked as soon as possible after a Sleep() (i.e., a
scheduler tick, 1/64sec on WinXP).  The calibration data is written to
the registry, at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NetSem\TTHEE, as follows:

  tscfreq        REG_QWORD  TSC frequency in ticks per second
  tscsd          REG_QWORD  measurement error (standard deviation) in above
  tcslastupdate  REG_SZ     ISO date of last update

TSCcal can accept two command-line arguments:

  TSCcal.exe n m

where n is the number of measurements to make, and m is the duration
(in milliseconds) of each measurement.  An OK choice would be 10
10000, which takes 100 seconds; a good one would be 10 100000, which
takes 1000 seconds.  This latter is the default.

If the DEBUG symbol is turned on, various output appears at stdio
describing what's going on, and at the end the application waits for a
character on the console (NOT stdio!) before it exits.

Ideally, this would be a Windows Service, but I couldn't be bothered
making it one, since that's a bit complicated.
