Since psyche doesn't really exist, attempts to send ethernet packets to it
will generally fail due to the inability to determine the correct ethernet
address to send them to. We get around this by adding a fake entry to the ARP
cache on each of the machines on the test network, by adding the following
line to /etc/rc.network, just above the "let future generations know we made
it" comment:

  arp -s 192.168.13.199 12:34:56:df:84:f4 pub

I don't think there's any significance at all to the ethernet address chosen,
but at the moment all the machines on the network are using the ones above.
Also note that it would theoretically be sufficient to do this on one machine
and specify the 'pub' option allowing it to act as an ARP server for this
address, but specifying it on every machine will hopefully avoid any nasty
surprises later on when we start changing the network topology or similar.
