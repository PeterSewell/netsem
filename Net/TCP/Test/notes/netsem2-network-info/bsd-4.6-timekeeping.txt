*** Getting accurate timing information from the BSD 4.6 hosts ***

There are several different changes which need making in order to get
sufficiently accurate timestamps in traces from the BSD hosts.

First we need to set a sysctl meaning "use precise versions of calls such as
microuptime() rather than approximations". To do this, add the following line
to /etc/sysctl.conf:

  kern.timecounter.method=1

This only takes effect at reboot, although you can use sysctl to set it right
away. But you'll be rebooting anyway before you're done, because the next step
is:

Rebuilding the kernel

Detailed instructions on doing this can be found in
netsem1-network-info/bsd-kernel-rebuild.txt. The salient points are: TAKE A
BACKUP FIRST, add TCPDEBUG to the options in the configuration file and apply
the patches to four files in /sys/netinet and one in /usr/include/netinet.
Also note that the newer machines need to be I686_CPU rather than I586_CPU (so
following the instructions exactly will, yes, cause the machines to kernel
panic on boot).

Finally, you need to set up NTP. [TODO]
