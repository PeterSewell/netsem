Boot from the CD.

Select 'English', 'United Kingdom' and 'British English' for language, location
and keymap respectively. Wait for things to load and DCHP auto-configuration to
fail.

Choose to configure the network manually. Enter the IP address (192.168.13.10x)
and netmask (255.255.255.0) and leave the gateway and nameserver blank.

Enter the hostname (jan/ada) and the domain (.netsem2). Wait for the device
prove to do its stuff.

Choose to erase the entire disk and then configure as a multi-user workstation.
For reference, jan and ada both have the following partition setup:
  #1 /     279.6MB
  #5 /usr  2.3GB
  #6 /var  1.1GB
  #7 swap  345.4MB
  #8 /tmp  189.1MB
  #9 /home 2.3GB
Write the changes to disk and confirm. Wait for a long time while the Debian
base system is installed.

Select 'yes' when asked if you want to install GRUB to the MBR. When prompted,
remove the Debian CD and reboot the system.

Set the time and time zone to whatever's correct, enter the root password twice
and then follow the instructions to create an initial user account for yourself
(suggest using your CRSid).

Decline to set up PPP and tell the system to install from cdrom instead.
Re-insert the Debian CD. When it's scanned that, say no when asked if you want
to scan another CD and dismiss the warnings about not having the most recent
security updates.

You don't need to install any of the additional selections of packages (web
server, desktop environment, etc.). You'll be asked to configure exim, but since
we don't want or need it, just decline to configure it when prompted.

If you're asked about configuring sshd, just select the default options (allow
ssh login, disable version 1, install ssh-keysign setuid root).
