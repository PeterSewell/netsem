Hi... we're about to start working a little more seriously on our TCP
semantics, and we need to do some machine rearrangement and software
installation, as follows.  We also need some privileged access to the
network card, as detailed further below.

1. MACHINE MOVE: We'd like thalamus, our HOL theorem-prover machine,
   to be moved from the machine room into FE21, to sit next to glia.
   Steve Bishop will be the main console user, but we'll continue to
   use it as a compute server.

2. WINDOWS INSTALL: We'd like glia to be made dual-boot, running
   Windows XP Professional as well as the existing lab-managed Linux.
   This is because we would like to run Visual Studio (probably .NET)
   on it.

   We would prefer to install and manage this entirely ourselves, as
   long as that is OK with the lab; we don't require access to file or
   print servers etc. from it.


Our goal is to implement our TCP semantics as a (Linux) program.  We
would run this implementation on thalamus, and it would accept and
generate IP packets as if it were a host with a TCP/IP stack.  In
order to do this, we need to be able to intercept incoming packets and
generate outgoing ones.  (Note that our program must be run on
thalamus, since it will be written in HOL and be fairly
computationally intensive.)

In order to do this, we need to be able to sniff all packets on the
wire (using tcpdump or libpcap), and insert new packets (using raw
sockets).  Hence:

3. ADDRESS ASSIGNMENT: We need an IP address and a host name ("psyche"
   seems appropriate!) for our implementation to use (we'll use the
   MAC address of thalamus' own card).  The program would accept
   packets destined for this address, and spoof responses from the
   address.

   We would test it by having it communicate with other machines in
   our office, including at least astrocyte and vesicle.

Our investigations show that the Linux capability CAP_NET_ADMIN is
sufficient for both tcpdump and raw sockets, and so we are not asking
for root access.  We need only something like the following:

4. PRIVILEGED ACCESS: Allow us to run arbitrary programs with
   CAP_NET_ADMIN, with a sudoers line like this (I think):

   kw217,pes20,smb50,mn200  thalamus=/sbin/execcap cap_net_admin=eip [!-]*

   For testing purposes it would be useful to have this on astrocyte
   as well.

Phew!  I know that's quite a lot to ask, but we'd be very grateful if
you could arrange it.

Thanks,
