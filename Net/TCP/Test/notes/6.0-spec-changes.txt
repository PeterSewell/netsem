When we were trying to make the spec work for FreeBSD 6.0, some things were
changed temporarily and found to work, but then changed back when we started
working with 4.6 again because we hadn't made them parameterisable yet. These
are things which should be reintroduced if we start working with FreeBSD 6.0
again:

Change defaults:

  SO_RCVBUF default on FreeBSD changed to 65536

  HZ changed from 100 to 1000 (changed from FreeBSD 5.4-6.0)

Change logic:

  Additional logic in calculate_buf_sizes for rfc3390 (see FreeBSD-5.4
  tcp_input.c, line 3139)

  Something needs to be done about silly window avoidance in
  make_syn_segment, make_syn_ack_segment, make_ack_segment and
  bsd_make_phantom_segment. This may technically be a bug in the spec even
  under 4.6, but didn't come up in previous tests against 4.6 traces.
