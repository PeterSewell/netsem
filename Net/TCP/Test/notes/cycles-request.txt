Subject: request for compute cycles
--------


Dear lab members of {theory,hvg,opera},

As you may know, a group of us are working on a post-hoc specification
of the behaviour of TCP, UDP, and the Sockets API.  An introduction to
the project can be found at

  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/Netsem/www-internal/index.html

(CL access only).  "The TCP Specification: A Quick Introduction" is
the place to start.

To validate the spec, checking that it includes all the real-world
behaviour, we run a special-purpose model checker (written above HOL)
over some 4000 captured traces.  This is fairly compute-heavy: each
full check run takes of the order of 50 cpu-days, and we need to
repeat them as we improve the spec.

Accordingly, we're trying to gather as much compute resource as
possible, and would greatly appreciate your permission to use the
otherwise-idle cycles on your machine.

We would run our jobs at the lowest possible priority (nice 19),
limited to 100MB per CPU, and only when you allow us to.

We're looking for CL Linux machines with at least a 600MHz processor and
256MB of memory (machines that do not meet this requirement are
automatically deselected by our tools). If you wish to check your own
machine's specification:

  cat /proc/cpuinfo
  cat /proc/meminfo

To enable your machine to be used, please create a world-readable
file in /usr/groups/tthee/conf/ with the same (fully-qualified) name
as your computer, for example /usr/groups/tthee/conf/yourmachine.cl.cam.ac.uk,
as follows.

To allow us to use your computer at any time 24/7, simply create an
empty file:

  cd /usr/groups/tthee/conf
  touch yourmachine.cl.cam.ac.uk
  chmod 644 yourmachine.cl.cam.ac.uk

Under normal circumstances you should not notice our jobs running at
all and allowing 24/7 use (as we do for our own machines) should not
be a problem.

To allow more restricted use, eg only outside working hours (0900-1759
Monday to Friday), see the further details at:

  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/Netsem/www-internal/timedonors.html

which describes also how you can terminate our usage (within 60s) at
any time.


many thanks,

Steve Bishop
