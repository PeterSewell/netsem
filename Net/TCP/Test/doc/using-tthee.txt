Keith tried to use tthee and tthee1/test.  Here are his experiences.

* Make sure that .ssh/authorized_keys on each isolated-subnet machine
(especially john.netsem, for tthee1/test) contains your
.ssh/identity.pub.  Otherwise you'll get prompted for a password.

* Delta isn't working properly - even setting it to 1000000usec (1
second) isn't sufficient to avoid time going backwards, even when the
difference is only 1msec:

   (** 1043427091.679998 "slurp0" **)
   Lh_senddatagram(TCP(<|
   [..]
   (* ## WARNING: time went backwards (negative epsilon transition) ## *)
   Lh_epsilon(duration(0, -998));

   (** 1043427091.679000 "debug0" **)
   (* 167 SYN_SENT:output [bb34fe62..bb34fe4e)@0(win=e000)<SYN> -> SYN_SENT *)
   Lh_trace(SOME(SOME(IP 192 168 0 12), SOME(Port 2299), SOME(IP 192 168 0 13), SOM
   [..]

(observed this with high debugging level; could it be related?  Would
be good if debugging didn't screw up the timing code...)

* Lots of blank lines are output to the console.

* Output of warnings etc only appears on the console at exit (not
  being flushed properly?).

* Sometimes (not always) hangs when debugging is set to OFF.

* When the test process is killed by ^C, not all the processes die -
  one remains.  The one remaining is blocked in a "select", if that
  helps:

    (gdb) bt
    #0  0x4013ab8e in __select () from /lib/libc.so.6
    #1  0x080a34dc in _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ () at eval.c:41
    #2  0x080c6d88 in ?? () at eval.c:41
