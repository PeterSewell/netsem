To build: libpcap must be installed in /usr/groups/netsem/ix86_linux-glibc-2.3.2-27.9 under the include and lib subdirectories. This path is specifed in the X86_PATH variable at the top of Makefile

slurp/ : an Ocaml program that uses libpcap to sniff ("slurp") the
network for packets that match a filter, rendering them to a TCP or
UNIX domain socket.

Usage: slurp [-h hostip] iface TCP ip port [filter]
       slurp [-h hostip] iface UNIX socket [filter]
where iface is the interface to sniff on
      ip and port specify the socket to output HOL labels to
      sockets specifies the UNIX domain socket to output HOL labels to
      filter is an option filter string (enclosed in double quotes)
      TCP selects output to TCP socket mode
      UNIX selects output to UNIX domain socket mode
