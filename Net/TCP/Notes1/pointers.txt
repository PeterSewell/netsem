Hi!

We have been working on platform independent solution for automated TCP
tests. Although, we do not feel 100% ready, we decided to share our
experience with this forum and also looking forward to get valuable
feedback from you.

Briefly, we test TCP features without performing any modification to
the tested implementation (using the black-box method).
The basic idea behind the applied methodology is to drive the TCP under
test into a specific state then apply a stimuli and check if we got the
right answer.

We believe that this approach is advantageous to the whole community,
since it gives a measure of correctness of implementations according to
the RFC.

We have been working parallel to the discussions in this list and
managed to develop formal description of tests, based on previous
versions of "Known TCP Implementation Problems (RFC 2525)". All test
cases are written in TTCN, an abstract notation, which has common use
in telecom protocol tests.

The use of such an abstraction allows TCP testers to write test scripts
based on this notation or use available tools for automatic compilation
and execution. We also performed these tests on 4 different
implementations (Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD and NT) and managed to detect
errors, which are not addressed by the RFC mentioned before. A
postscript version of the paper (submitted to INFOCOM2000)describing
method and experiences can be found online on

http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/papers/infocom2000/591-2818661292.ps

We are awaiting your comments,

Roland Gecse, Peter Kremer.

Mark Allman, Aaron Falk. On the Effective Evaluation of TCP, ACM
Computer Communication Review, 29(5), October 1999.

Understanding the performance of the Internet's Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) is important because it is the dominant protocol used
in the Internet today. Various testing methods exist to evaluate TCP
performance, however all have pitfalls that need to be understood
prior to obtaining useful results. Simulating TCP is difficult
because of the wide range of variables, environments, and
implementations available. Testing TCP modifications in the global
Internet may not be the answer either: testing new protocols on real
networks endangers other people's traffic and, if not done
correctly, may also yield inaccurate or misleading results. In order
for TCP research to be independently evaluated in the Internet
research community there is a set of questions that researchers
should try to answer. This paper attempts to list some of those
questions and make recommendations as to how TCP testing can be
structured to provide useful answers.

PS: this looks pretty good

RFC 2398 - survey of TCP testing tools  (August 1998)

PS: the most relevant looks like

2.7.  Tcpanaly
   ...
   This is a tool for automatically analyzing a TCP implementation's
   behavior by inspecting packet traces of the TCP's activity. It does
   so through packet filter traces produced by tcpdump.  It has coded
   within it knowledge of a large number of TCP implementations.  Using
   this, it can determine whether a given trace appears consistent with
   a given implementation, and, if so, exactly why the TCP chose to
   transmit each packet at the time it did.
   ...

Note that a friend of K's, Richard Black, says:

  "Note that Ethereal uses a libpcap
  implementation which is known to have a large number of concurrency bugs
  (but which still mostly works)." (email,

Hmmm, I saw a bunch of compliance testing kits on the web today (linked through
from another post). Try http://www.ixiacom.com/products/caa/
