What versions are there?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux, BSD, Windows are the obvious ones.  Folklore has it that
Windows is now BSD, give or take.  This should be checked.

An interesting thread on c.p.tcp-ip says that there are really only
three flavours of interest, and names one I hadn't heard of, "Mentat",
which does high-performance stuff I think.  Links:

http://www.mentat.com/tcp/tcp.html

  Mentat TCPTM is a high-performance, fully compliant, STREAMS-based
  implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite.  On-going testing
  demonstrates that Mentat TCP delivers performance far beyond that of
  other implementations of TCP/IP while also providing the highest
  levels of functionality, scalability, reliability, and
  maintainability. The feature-rich code is 64-bit compatible and
  includes advanced features such as IPv6, IP Security (IPsec), IP
  multicast, and large windows.

  Mentat TCP has been integrated as the native TCP/IP in many of the
  leading operating systems including Hewlett-Packard HP-UX 11 and Apple
  Mac OS. Originally written for Sun Microsystems, Mentat TCP forms the
  base of the native TCP/IP stack on Solaris. In addition, Mentat TCP
  has been ported to a wide variety of computer and real time operating
  systems including Linux, Microsoft Windows NT, Wind River VxWorks, SCO
  UnixWare, and other operating systems.

And the thread:

Interesting points:

Rick Jones:
  I suspect there are really only two or three "main branches" of TCP/IP
  stack these days. BSDish, Linux and Mentat.

Vernon Schryver:
  Sun has been other than BSD flavored for the many years since Sun
  bosses soiled their pants about what AT&T (or certain consultants)
  had done to the UCB copyright messages in the BSD TCP source that had
  somehow appeared in System V.  In their pointy haired panic at what
  the long sleeping but finally arroused Regents could do to AT&T/System
  V, they tossed everything related to BSD TCP...or so I've been told
  by Sun programmers who ought to know.  They are long time network
  kernel hacks who were there and not in sales or marketing or above
  2nd level management.

  I've also had a little, somewhat more direct contact with the Mentat
  people.  For reasons that are variously good and bad, I trust they
  did keep any taint of BSD out of their STREAMS modules.  I don't know
  what might have crept back in since the early 1990's.

  When I've seen performance problems between BSD TCP kernel code I was
  responsible for and Sun's, it was with the non-BSD flavor of Sun's code.

  While Rick Jones is available, I wouldn't presume to say anything
  about the history of HP's TCP code.



Discussion of what to use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the moment, I'm using the POSIX 1003.1-2001 API, with some
extensions; this isn't really very specific.

In terms of what operating system(s) to install and test
(experimentally validate) our semantics against:

- We want to use BSD.  Gareth (and Steve) recommend (the latest
  stable) FreeBSD, because:

  - most desktops and servers that run BSD run that flavour
  - OpenBSD is targetted at being reliable/secure/stable; every line
    of code is very carefully checked (i.e., special interest).
  - NetBSD is targetted at running on as many different platforms as
    possible (i.e., special interest).
  - BSD/OS - don't know.

% Can't really say much about net and open, but from what I've heard, the

%
%
% FreeBSD:  Widely used as a desktop/server operating system -- more of a
% rival to Linux on the server side, but has a compatible ABI (as well as the
% native FreeBSD ABI).  Used quite a bit by internet service providers.
% Derived from BSD4.3 (it says on your wall) but now mainly based (or soon to
% be) on 4.4 as I believe they have released the 4.4 code (?).  I
% specifically remember that they are ripping the thread scheduling code from
% 4.4 (things like the granularity of the big lock for kernel access etc).
% More feature rich than the other two (and the one that I've used).
%
% NetBSD:  Portable (runs on everything - including your toaster). Used by
% NASA on some space shuttle.
%
% OpenBSD: Secure.

versions):

Gareth added some more comments about BSD here:

%
% Don't know if this effects you or not, but in FreeBSD 5.0 they are
% integrating ALTQ (a QoS for TCP) into the TCP stack.  Net & Open already
% have it, and it's available as a patch for 4.5 (and probably 4.6) of
% FreeBSD. It involves some major changes (apparently might break binary
% compatibility for net drivers) Here are some links:

BSD version used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The BSD installed by Steve on john.netsem and emil.netsem is

  FreeBSD 4.6, downloaded on or around 17 July 2002.

This can be obtained from

  http://www.freebsd.org/releases/4.6R/announce.html

The exact patchlevel and date of the kernel is presently unknown
(STEVE PLEASE FILL THIS INFO IN).  It *should* be the same on
john.netsem and emil.netsem; this is to be checked.

ALSO NEED TO CHECK VERSION of libc or whatever the native C compiler
uses.

Presuming that /usr/src/sys of a fresh install is consistent with the
kernel installed by that install, the source code of the relevant BSD
is to be found in /usr/groups/netsem/Src/FreeBSD-4.6/.  This has been
MD5-checked to be the same as that on john.netsem (on 2002-08-05), and
was extracted from the FreeBSD 4.6 disc 1 that is preserved in FE21
for posterity.  (the actual install was performed from the net, rather
than from the CD, hence the version uncertainty).

Both john and emil report the same uname -a information (modulo
hostname of course!):

FreeBSD john 4.6-RELEASE FreeBSD 4.6-RELEASE #0: Tue Jun 11 06:14:12
GMT 2002 murray@builder.freebsdmall.com:/usr/src/sys/compile/GENERIC
i386

(not sure why john doesn't know its domain)
