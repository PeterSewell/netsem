LEVELS of implementation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0: POSIX alone

1: POSIX + sock-visible TCP states + networky streamy thing

   1': like 1, but in a reliable world  (useless)
   1'': small frag of 1 in a reliable world (might be useful)

2: POSIX + wire-format TCP states and messages,
    nondeterministic flow control

3: (virtual node :-)): a particular algorithm, deterministic.

   3.1: 2 + flow control algorithms, but in other places still nondet
   3.2: refinement of 3.1 which is deterministic in all the
        algorithmic places.
