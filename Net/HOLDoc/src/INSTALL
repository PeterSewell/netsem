Installing HOLDoc
=================


Downloading
~~~~~~~~~~~

To obtain the latest version of HOLDoc, download it from the
SourceForge CVS repository (it's part of the HOL project,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/).

The munger will be installed in a subdirectory named HOLDoc.  First
select a directory in which you would like this subdirectory to be
created, and cd there.

Then, do the following:

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/hol login

  # press Enter to the password prompt

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/hol co -d HOLDoc hol98/tools/holdoc

You may need to try several times; SF seems to be fairly heavily loaded.


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have OCaml version 3.06 installed.  This can be obtained from

  http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html


Building
~~~~~~~~

Once you have OCaml installed, set the OCAMLPATH variable in the
HOLDoc Makefile to point to the installed location.

Then type

  make

to build all the tools.


Using
~~~~~

You can now use the tools!  See holdoc-guide.txt for more information,
and see the examples/mng/ and examples/lts directories for some
examples of its use (typing make in either of these directories should
build the examples).


Enjoy!
