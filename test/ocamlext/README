This directory contains:

i) rawsock -- raw socket extensions to OCAML's unix library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * must do 'open Unix;;' before 'open Rawsock;;' when this library is used
  * must link againsts OCAML's unix.cma, rawsock.cma and librawsock.a
  * exports two functions:

    raw_socket: socket_domain -> int -> file_descr
      where socket_domain = Unix.PF_INET | Unix.PF_UNIX
      and   int is the protocol  number   (e.g. 6=TCP)
      Returns a file descriptor (socket descriptor)

    raw_sockopt_hdrincl: file_descr -> unit
      Sets the socket option to include your own header
      in the raw socket output. N.B. UNDER BSD you MUST leave the
      IP checksum as ZERO as the BSD kernel inserts its own checksum


ii) platform - a set of library functions to report platform specifics such as the hostname

iii) threadparsing - a threadsafe implementation of the Ocaml parser. Works alongside parser_hack_script which is compatiable with Ocaml v3.06 and takes the .ml output by post-ocaml-yacc and makes it thread safe by forcing it to use the ThreadParsing library implemented here. See ../common/Makefile for a demonstration of how to use this.
