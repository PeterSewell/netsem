A wrapper around the nssock library (nssock/), that effectively
renames each ns_* call to be the name of the real socket call it wraps
around. This is used to attach an instrumented sockets implementation to
existing applications that use the sockets library in glibc.

Effectively you get:

    Application (e.g. Mozilla)
   -------------
   socket_preload
   -------------
      nssock
   -------------
      glibc

and when the application is run, you get a trace of all the socket
calls and their returns (in HOL label format). Funky!

This requires some cleverness to link as the socket functions in
socket_preload are IDENTICALLY named to those in glibc.

As all of this is a little tricky, a script in Test/utils/dlhack has
been written that will attach all this to an application on your
behalf. It is also a good tutorial on how to do this stuff!
