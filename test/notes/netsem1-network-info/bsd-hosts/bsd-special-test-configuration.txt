This document assumes the following network topology:

192.168.0/24  john(BSD), kurt(linux), alan(linux)
192.168.1/24  emil(BSD), alan(linux)

with alan(linux) working as the router

-------------------

/etc/hosts:

# Do not remove the following line, or various programs
# that require network functionality will fail.
127.0.0.1               localhost.localdomain localhost
192.168.0.1             astrocyte.cl.cam.ac.uk astrocyte
192.168.0.2             thalamus.cl.cam.ac.uk thalamus
192.168.0.3             glia.cl.cam.ac.uk glia
192.168.0.11            kurt.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk kurt
192.168.0.12            john.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk john
192.168.1.13            emil.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk emil
192.168.0.14            alan.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk alan
192.168.0.99            psyche.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk psyche

-------------------

In order to facilitate testing the following patch
(bsd-hosts/rc.network.patch-{john,emil}) has to be applied to /etc/rc.network. The
patch polutes the ARP cache with a permanent entry for the virtual
host psyche (192.168.0.99) and allows the host to publish this to all
other hosts on the network. It also makes the kernel timecounter
(getmicrotime) more accurate by forcing a real time query each time
getmicrotime is called (rather than using the last cached time which
could be upto 10ms old).

Finally, it configures routing such that hosts can see the other
subnet:
