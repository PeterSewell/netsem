------------------------------------------------
Installation of RedHat Linux v9 on Alan and Kurt
------------------------------------------------

Create boot floppies
--------------------
- download the floppy disk images 'bootdisk.img' and 'drvnet.img' from
  ftp://ftp.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/9/en/os/i386/images

- use 'dd if=xxxxx.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=1440k' to write both images to blank
  floppy disks


Setup network access for package installation
---------------------------------------------
- on john.netsem, as root, setup port forwarding:
  ssh -N -L 80:astrocyte:7000 -g smb50@john

- on astrocyte as an ordinary user setup port forwarding:
  ssh -N -L 7000:ftp.redhat.com:80 -g -b 192.168.0.1 astrocyte

- this setup allows port 80 on john (which is locally accessible by
  alan and kurt) to masquerade as http://ftp.redhat.com/


Beginning the installation
--------------------------
- insert the floppy containing the image 'bootdisk.img' and reboot

- at the Redhat installation welcome screen type:
  linux text <enter>

- wait for the linux kernel to boot and the redhat installer to load

- select the language 'English' and press 'OK'

- select the keyboard layout 'UK' and press 'OK'

- select the installation media type as 'HTTP' and press 'OK'

- At the 'drivers' screen select 'Use driver disk', insert the
  'drvnet.img' floppy and select 'OK'

- After a while you will be told that 'no drivers were found'. Select
  'manually select'.

- Select the network device '3com Etherlink III (3C509)' and press
  'OK'.

- At the network configuation screen uncheck 'Use dynamic IP
  Configuartion' and manually enter the following:
  IP: 192.168.0.11 or 192.168.0.14 (depending upon the host)
  Netmask: 255.255.255.0
  Default Gateway: 192.168.0.1
  Leave the primary nameserver entry blank

- Select 'OK' and wait whilst the hostname is determined

- Next you are prompted to enter the web site name and directory where
  the redhat packages can be found. Enter:
  Website name: 192.168.0.12
  RedHat Directory: pub/redhat/linux/9/en/os/i386/

- Select 'OK' and wait whilst the base packages are retrieved

- In the next installer program, press 'OK' at the welcome screen.

- Select 'Generic 3-button mouse (PS/2)', ensure 'Emulate 3-buttons' is not
  ticked and press 'OK'

- If the installer detects a previous RedHat installation you should
  select 'Reinstall system' and press 'OK' at this point (if a
  previous RedHat system is not present this stage is skipped)

- Select 'Custom' installation and then 'Disk Druid' for partitioning
  the disk

- In Disk druid, delete all existing partitions and create:
  /dev/hda1, 1291MB, ext2, Mount point /
  /dev/hda2, 255MB, swap

- Select 'OK' and then 'OK' again to enable the swap partition because
  of the low memory warning

- Select 'Lilo' as the preferred bootloader

- Select 'OK' at the lilo kernal optional parameters screen leaving the
  options field blank

- Select 'OK' at the 'Boot Manager Configuration' screen, leaving the
  default options in place (i.e., the ability to boot /dev/hda1 from
  lilo)

- Select to install lilo on /dev/hda (the MBR), not /dev/hda1 and press 'OK'

- At the 'Network Configuration' screen, delete the IP address for the
  'Primary Nameserver' then select 'OK' to accept the default options

- Enter the computer's hostname (i.e., alan or kurt) and press 'OK'.

- Select the 'No firewall' option and press 'OK'.

- Select extra language support 'English (Great Britain)' then press
  'OK'

- Select the default language as 'English (Great Britain)' and press
  'OK'.

- Select the default timezone as 'Europe/London' leaving 'Hardware
  clock set to GMT' unchecked, then press 'OK'

- Enter a password to become the root password and press 'OK'

- At the 'Authentication Configuration' screen hit 'OK' to accept the
  defaults (i.e., shadow and MD5 passwords enabled).

- Wait whilst 'Package information' is read


Package Installation
--------------------

- At the 'Package Group Selection' screen uncheck everything except:
  Administration Tools
  Development Tools
  Kernel Development
  System Tools
  Text-based internet

- Leave 'Select individual packages' unchecked and press 'OK'

- Wait for the dependency check to finish then press 'OK' to select
  the default installation logging option

- while(true) sleep++;
  (You have to wait a long time before the package installation
  begins. The installer leaves you with a blue screen and no message
  windows explaining what is going on for approximately 5
  minutes.... and there is no give away disk or network activity...)

- Then wait even longer whilst the 800Mb of packages install :-)
  (approx 1 hr)

- Provide a blank floppy to create a bootdisk (in case anything ever
  goes wrong)

- Reboot and enjoy


Post-install configuration
--------------------------

- create users smb50, kw217, pes20 by running 'useradd' as root. Use
  'passwd {username}' to set the user passwords

- run 'hostname kurt.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk' or 'hostname
  alan.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk' to configure the hostname

- sshd is configured sanely already so sshd_config can be left as is

- edit '/etc/hosts':
  127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain localhost
  192.168.0.1	astrocyte.cl.cam.ac.uk astrocyte
  192.168.0.2	thalamus.cl.cam.ac.uk thalamus
  192.168.0.3	glia.cl.cam.ac.uk glia
  192.168.0.11	kurt.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk kurt
  192.168.0.12	john.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk john
  192.168.0.13	emil.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk emil
  192.168.0.14	alan.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk alan
  192.168.0.99	psyche.netsem.cl.cam.ac.uk psyche

- copy RSA1 public keys into /home/{username}/.ssh to enable RSA1
  authentication. Note: the version of openssh with Redhat v9 forces
  RSA1 keys to be >= 768 bits!
