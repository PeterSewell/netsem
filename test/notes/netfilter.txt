Update 2004-09-17: this is all pre-slurper and pre-injector: we were
thinking of ways to slurp and inject packets.


Some notes on Netfilter

Below are the requirements for using Netfilter.  The Linux Kernel requires
building with certain options enabled and some patching from the iptables
tools library beforehand.

We need to make a decision on how we give our applications that talk to the
ip_queue the relevant capabilities. We can:
	(a) ask for the installation of the Linux capabilities libraries and tools
package. We would then required setuid root or sudo privileges on setcap,
getcap, execcap and getpcap.
	(b) write a daemon (or a kludgey middle-ware tool) which we then ask to be
setuid root or sudo enabled.

Thoughts?

iptables library:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - download iptables-1.2.6a from www.netfilter.org
 - follow build instructions but in brief:
 	(a) `make pending-patches`
	  (this patches the current kernel in /usr/src/linux or that
           specified by KERNEL_DIR). ONLY apply the patches that are
	   marked as non-conflicting -- don't worry about any that fail.
	(b) make and install the new kernel (see below)
	(c) `make`
	(d) `make install`
	(e) `make install-devel` (required for our ip_queue api)


Linux Kernel:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - 2.4.x series
 - do a `make clean` followed by `make mrproper`. The `mrproper` is required
because of the patching above.
 - build with the following options enabled (Y=build in, M=module):
	- CONFIG_NETFILTER (M)
	- CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK (M)
	- CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES  (M)
	- CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MAC (M)
	- CONFIG_IP_NF_MATH_MULTIPORT (M)
	- CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TCPMSS (M)
	- CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE (M)
	- CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER (M)
	- CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT (M)
	- CONFIG_IP_NF_MANGLE (M)
	- CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_LOG (M)
 - I assume the lab builds it's kernels with the kernel module autoloader (if
not, a startup script needs to `insmod ip_tables` and `insmod iptable_filter`)


Permissions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - either need setuid root or sudo permissions for /usr/local/bin/iptables
 - need the linux capabilities tools (and permissions to run them) or
appropriate permissions on our own userspace tool/daemon to access the ip_queue

Must all build the kernel with:

CONFIG_IP_NF_QUEUE


(this *only* appears in 'menuconfig' if it is set to show
development/experimental stuff).

Should read "must also..."
