Notes on configuration of WinXP on glia:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Installed on 2nd hard drive (13Gb partition) (i.e. Windows is on drive D:!)

* Networking:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- two interfaces, one on lab network, other on netsem private network

- configuration is easiest via Control Panel -> Network and Internet Connections -> Network Connections

- WINXP install detects and configures both the network cards

- Local Area Connection is the PCI card, Local Area Connection 2 is the integrated Intel controller

- Configure "Local Area Connection" by double-clicking its icon, select "Properties" then "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" and press the "Properties" button. This connection will be on the private NETSEM network:
	- Press the "advanced" button
	- Enter IP address of 192.168.0.3 netmask 255.255.255.0
	- Do not enter a default gateway
	- Do not enter anything on the DNS tab
 	- Do not enter anything on the WINS tab
	- On the WINS tab, tick "Enable LMHOSTS lookup" and import an LMHOSTS file (this is for ns lookup).
		Create the following file to import: D:\Windows\lmhosts.txt
		   astrocyte 192.168.0.1
		   thalamus 192.168.0.2
		   glia 192.168.0.3
		   kurt 192.168.0.11
		   john 192.168.0.12
		   emil 192.168.0.13
		   alan 196.168.0.13

- Configure "Local Area Connection 2" by double-click its icon, select "properties" then "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" and press the "Properties" button. This connection will be on the CL network:
	- Press the "advanced" button
	- Enter IP addres of 128.232.13.142 netmask 255.255.240.0
	- Enter a default gateway of 128.232.0.1
	- On the DNS tab enter three DNS servers 128.232.1.1 - 128.232.1.3
	- On the WINS tab enter two WINS address 128.232.13.15; 128.232.13.16
	- NB: LMHOSTS lookup will be ticked (as this configuration is shared)
	- Enable NetBIOS over TCP/IP should be select

* User accounts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- do not set the Administrator password. This will be set by the nt-admin's.

- create user accounts for everybody (with CLSID's and normal user privs)
- if people wish to have admin accounts then create admin accounts named as (initialsadmin)
  e.g. kwadmin, sbadmin

- currently set up with smb50, kw217, sbadmin, kwadmin

- for added security in Control Panel -> User accounts -> Change the way users log on or off
  untick both boxes and press apply. This enables old fashioned style logon, ctrl-alt-del handling
  and password protected screensavers.



* Misc:
~~~~~~~

- fiddled around slightly with display options (to make desktop nicer ;-)

- create a directory d:\install to store the original installation images of any non-standard software that is installed (e.g. virus checkers)


* Anti-virus software:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- must be installed from an account with admin rights

- download latest version of McAfee from http://www-tus.csx.cam.ac.uk/virus/downloadindex.html.

- Version 4.5.1 was used at the time of writing. It is a self-extracting archive which you should unzip into d:\install\vscan451. Run setup.exe to install.

- Options selected: Maximum security (so only admins can turn it off), typical installation

- Allow it to run "AutoUpdate" to get the latest virus definition fil*es


* MS Visual Studio.NET:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- go to \\liverpoolst\VS.NET and login with a WINNT domain account

- run setup.exe

- allow it to perform the "Windows Components Update". Select the "Continue" option in order not to configure the machine for hosting "Web projects"

- Agree to the license agreement and enter the product key.

- Select ALL the components for installation by unchecking the top of the install tree then rechecking the tick box (about 2.2GB install)

- After installation is complete, do a seach for the "Service Releases". At time of writing no releases where available.

- Install Windows XP SP1 and Microsoft .NET Framework SP2


* SSH/SCP:
~~~~~~~~~~

- installed PutTy  and PSCP from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html (latest release version)

- also download plink, pageant and puttygen as they are useful tools use by third party programs (e.g. WinCVS)


* CVS client:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- download WinCVS from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10072&release_id=24467.

- Using version 1.3b8

- download Python version 2.2.1 from www.python.org. Install it using all of the default options.


* CVS client setup:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- run puttygen to generate a key pair (SSH1 RSA). Copy and paste the public key into $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys on CVS server (thalamus). Save both the public and private key locally in c:\putty. Run Pageant and register the new private key with it. To test the RSA authentication run c:\putty\plink.exe username@thalamus.netsem and check it auto logs in.

- configure WinCVS:
	- Go to WinCVS preferences and select the general tab
	- Select authentication "ssh" and enter CVSROOT: username@thalamus.netsem:/usr/groups/netsem/cvs
	- press the "Settings" button
	- Tick "RSA public identity file" and enter "D:\Putty\[publickeyfilename]"
	- Tick "If ssh is not in the PATH" and enter "D:\putty\plink.exe"
	- Go to the "WinCVS" tab and enter the HOME directory as "D:\home"
	- Press OK.

- To check it is configured correctly:
	- select "Checkout module" from "Create" menu
	- Enter "D:\" as "Local folder to checkout to"
	- Enter "Net" in "Module Name...."
	- Press "OK". If all is configured correctly then the Net module should be succesfully checked out into D:\Net

* Notes:
~~~~~~~~
- D:\home is a directory that contains the .cvs files (usually stored in $HOME/.cvs)
- D:\Net is where the checked out code for module Net is stored


* libpcap:
~~~~~~~~~~
- download Win32 version from http://winpcap.politoit/
- version downloaded 2.3 (as 3.0 was still a beta release at the time)
- following installation instructions for the auto-installer
- also need to download the developer's pack and extract this somewhere (contains the libraries and dll files)

* ntp client:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- download nettime from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nettime/
- require the executable version (the zip file contains the pascal source)
- version downloaded 2.0b7
