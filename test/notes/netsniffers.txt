Evaluation of network packet sniffers: pros and cons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Ethereal
  - data can be captured live or from a file (produced by tcpdump and many others)
  - supports many link layer protocols (e.g., ether, PPP, 802.11...)
  - GUI
  - flexibile filter options, packet colouring, different packet view modes (e.g. ascii contents of payload)
  - all captured network traces can be saved to disk
  - understands more protocols than you care to think about ;-)
  - can view protocols as if you were the server or client
  - support for *all* platforms
  - open source

* Snoop
  - command line based
  - msdos executable only
  - allows filter of ethernet/IP/TCP
  - no nice output; just raw hex with a few flags highlighted
  - free and code available

* tcpshow
  - command line based
  - mainly for unix/bsd but linux & win ports available
  - very basic filtering (e.g. don't show headers)
  - decodes header information to the extend of delimiting fields and naming flags
  - not as good as the current tcpdump tools; this was created before tcpdump was improved
  - support for ethernet, ARP, RARP, IP, ICMP, UDP, TCP only

* tcptrace
  - pretty useless --> statistical connection analysis + pretty graphs ;-)

* Network flight recorder
  - can't find a copy -- only references to it and www.nfr.com who now only seem to sell intrusion detection h/w

* ntop
  - another net stats tool...

* sniffit
  - equivalent to modern versions of tcpdump (understands IP, TCP, ICMP only)

* sniff'em
  - windows packet sniffer
