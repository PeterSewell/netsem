Installing bash and GNU Make

bash is easy, since it's in the FreeBSD 4.6 standard distribution. Run
/stand/sysinstall and select to install packages, it's under shells. Now make
/bin/bash a symlink to /usr/local/bin/bash, because our build scripts seem to
expect it.

makedepend is, for some reason, a ridiculously awkward piece of software to
get hold of. You get it automatically if you install XFree86, but we don't
want to waste time doing that. Instead, install it using sysinstall (it's in
devel), which doesn't really install it, but puts some stuff in
/usr/ports/devel/makedepend, because that's the way the ports collection
works. So then, we need to download ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/
OLD_VERSIONS/imap/cyrus-imapd-2.0.9.tar.gz and put it in /usr/ports/distfiles.
Once that's done, as root, cd to /usr/ports/devel/makedepend and type make.

We need GNU Make because the autotest toolchain's makefiles don't work in BSD's
default make. It's easier to install it directly than bother with the ports
collection in this case, so:

First back up the old make in case you need it later to build ports:

  cp /usr/bin/make /usr/bin/bsd-make

Get http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/make-3.80.tar.gz, put it on the machine
in question and extract it. Run /configure -prefix=/usr, make, make check, su,
make install.

Suggest doing this in case you do end up swapping makes around:

  mv /usr/bin/make /usr/bin/gmake
  ln -s /usr/bin/gmake /usr/bin/make

Note that gmake is no good for building ports; specifically, don't install it
until you've built linuxthreads and makedepend!
