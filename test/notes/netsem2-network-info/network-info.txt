Administrative info for the new test network, just in case I get hit by a bus:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new test network has been set up by the network admins. This is a VLAN
running on the lab's switching system; apparently the VLAN tag, whatever that
is, is 490.

We have been asked to use the 192.168.13.0/24 subnet and the physical ports
WC1C-04-3, WC1C-04-4 (both under the far table in FE17) and WC1E-40-4 (under
Adam's desk in FS20).

Originally connected to these ports were:

WC1C-04-3: a five-port switch, connected to which are:
  alf.netsem2 (FreeBSD), 192.168.13.101
  ken.netsem2 (FreeBSD), 192.168.13.102
  what will become jan.netsem2 (Linux), 192.168.13.103
  what will become ada.netsem2 (Linux), 192.168.13.104
WC1C-04-4: nothing, but there will be another switch connecting to:
  what will become dag.netsem2 (WinXP), 192.168.13.105
  what will become tom.netsem2 (WinXP), 192.168.13.106
WC1E-40-4: directly connected to:
  fornix.netsem2 (lab machine), 192.168.13.200

The topology of the network is subject to change, since we might conceivably
want two hosts to have to communicate via a third, in order to fabricate
artificial network loss.

AS OF JUNE 2006,

Nothing is connected to W1C1-04-4. W1C1-04-3 is connected to an eight-port
non-switched hub, which is connected to:
  alf.netsem2 (FreeBSD 5.4), 192.168.13.101
  ken.netsem2 (FreeBSD 6.0), 192.168.13.102
  jan.netsem2 (Debian Linux), 192.168.13.103
  ada.netsem2 (Debian Linux), 192.168.13.104
  dag.netsem2 (FreeBSD 4.6), 192.168.13.105
  tom.netsem2 (FreeBSD 4.6), 192.168.13.106

fornix is still connected to the network via WC1E-40-4. zonule is now also
directly connected to the network via one of the ports under Tom's desk.

The machines in FE17 are labelled with stickers, but they keep falling off in
the heat, so for easy future physical identification of the machines, they are
positioned thus:

[ada]  [tom]
[jan]  [dag]
[ken]
[alf]

alf, ken, jan and ada are under the table with the printers on, and the hub
and KVM are on top of them. The monitor is on top of dag and tom.
