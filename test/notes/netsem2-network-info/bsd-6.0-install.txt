Boot from the FreeBSD-6.0-RELEASE install CD and choose 'standard installation'.

When prompted to create partitions, press 'A' for 'use entire disk' followed by
'Q'. Choose to install a standard MBR and then automatically create partitions
with 'A'. On ken, this results in the following:

a   /     512MB
b   swap  486MB
d   /var  1267MB
e   /tmp  512MB
f   /usr  3371MB

Select 'Q' to finish. When asked to select a distribution, choose 'developer'
and decline to install the ports collection. Select 'install from CD', confirm
everything and watch it go.

After the installation, elect to configure Ethernet devices, select the device
from the list, say 'no' to IPv6 and DHCP, then enter the appropriate settings.
