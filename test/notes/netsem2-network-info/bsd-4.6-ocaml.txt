Installing OCaml

OCaml 3.08 basically builds out-of-the-box on the FreeBSD 4.6 machines. Make
sure to do 'configure -prefix=/usr/groups/netsem/ocaml-3.08 -with-pthreads'.

The netsem1 install documentation suggests lots of tweaks to the configuration
which look like they're redundant with the switching of linuxthreads for
pthreads described earlier (but bear this in mind as a candidate if it turns
out not to work).

Suggest symlinking /usr/groups/netsem/ocaml to /usr/groups/netsem/ocaml-3.08.

Once OCaml is installed, we need to also make copies of various bits of the
build tree for later use, so copy the otherlibs, config and byterun
directories from the build directory into /usr/groups/netsem/ocaml-3.08.
