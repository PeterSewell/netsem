Dummies guide to setting up passwordless SSH login to the netsem2 machines:

For the distribute and autotests scripts to work, you need to be able to have
both 'ssh alf.netsem2' and 'ssh root@alf.netsem2' log you in automatically
without a password.

You probably already have an identity on the lab network, so ssh to fornix and
scp your id_rsa.pub to one of the netsem2 machines, say alf. Then ssh to alf
(using your password) and copy the id_rsa.pub into .ssh/authorized_keys. Also
*append* it onto /.ssh/authorized_keys in order to let the same key log you in
as root (you have to be root to do this, obviously), but be careful not to
delete the existing contents of root's authorized_keys file or you'll stop
everyone else logging in.

If you want, you can create another ssh identity on the test network to let you
ssh from one machine to the other more easily. I wouldn't recommend just copying
your existing private key if you value the security of your lab network login
since we don't generally consider the test machines' root accounts to be secure.
Similarly, if you want to be able to ssh back to fornix from the test machines,
make sure the key on the test machines is passphrase-protected.

Note that on machines running FreeBSD 4.6, the file to which you need to add
the keys is authorized_keys2 rather than authorized_keys. Also note that on
BSD machines root is forbidden by default from logging in over SSH; to fix
this, change the line 'PermitRootLogin no' to 'PermitRootLogin yes' in
/etc/ssh/sshd_config and then restart sshd with 'kill -s HUP'.
