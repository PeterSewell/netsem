Update written by SMB 2004-09-17 (from memory):

If we ever need to run the slurper or any libpcap based application on
a Computer Lab managed machine, then this can be achieved by having
something similar to the following in the sudoers file: it allows
applications to run with CAPABILITY_NET_ADMIN, a Linux network
administration capability that includes network sniffing
permissions. We thus don't have to have root privs!

# sudoers file.

# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.

# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
