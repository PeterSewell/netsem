This is a custom_rsh tool designed to run on Windows. It is run as a
Windows service using srvany.exe (a WinXP program that will
wrap-aroudn and run any non-interactive win32 program as a Windows
service).

It listens on a specific IP and port for instruction from tthee to
run or kill one or more of the tools: libd, slurper, or injector with
different command-line arguments.

Sorry: this is all a bit hacked and undocumented, but it does work :-)
