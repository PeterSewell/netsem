autotest - the autotest library and autotest'ing program. All of the
TCP and UDP test scripts live here, along with the scripts to run them
and produce the traced output.

common - a collection of useful constants and functions in Ocaml that
are shared by autotest and the other tests under Test/tests. These
typically define things like the IP addresses of the machines on our
test network, etc etc

adhoc - a collection of small tests written over the past few years on
an adhoc basis to test for behaviours we have been
interested in. Mostly unimportant. These tests are pre-tthee and
pre-autotest and rely only on ocamllib.

tthee - another collection of small tests written over the past few
years on an adhoc basis to produce traces for behaviours we have been
interested in. Mostly unimportant. These DIFFER from adhoc because
they rely on tthee for their operation. These were written pre-autotest.

linkhack - a quick test written to test dynamic linking. Now
deprecated as the knowledge is incorporated into Test/dynamic and
Test/utils/dlhack.

parser_test - a line-buffered console application to test our HOL
label parser in Test/common. A HOL label is entered at the command
line and the output of parsing it (either success or failure) is
output to the console. If parsing is successful, a summary is given of
the parsed label.
