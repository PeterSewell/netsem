demo traces - pulling into CVS all the demo traces and check output we
use to make the paper

Traces taken from:

  /usr/groups/tthee/batch/demo-traces/trace5000,5000aux-inv,5001,5001aux-inv,5002,5003

Of these, the traces

  trace5000aux-inv, trace5001aux-inv

are send/recv-inverted versions of the aux traces (workaround bug in
the trace generation tools) which were generated by "make inv" in that batch/demo-traces directory.


Check output (trace500xXYZ.out.html) taken from the check run:

  /usr/groups/tthee-scratch/check/check-2004-12-16T15\:07\:00+0000/*.out.html

but should be taken from a new run, with config file   check/run_demo.conf


For traces trace0241 (single page) and trace1741 (multi-page) the
trace and check output are respectively from:

  /usr/groups/tthee/batch/autotest-tcp-2004-10-01T16:28:00+0100
  /auto/groups/tthee-scratch/check/check-2004-12-16T20:04:23+0000
