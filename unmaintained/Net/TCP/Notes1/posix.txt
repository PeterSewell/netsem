Notes on the POSIX standard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(skip next two sections to get to the meaty bit)

Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

POSIX 1003.1-2001 is in the Computer Laboratory library as ST.8.7 1
through ST.8.7 7.

It's also available on the Web (a first!!) as

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/toc.htm

and I've downloaded it (from
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/download/susv3.tar.bz2)
and installed it at

/usr/groups/netsem/Std/susv3/index.html

(please note terms and conditions at
/usr/groups/netsem/Std/susv3/help/terms.html)

Bibliographic data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard is called:

IEEE Std 1003.1\texttrademark{}-2001\\
Standard for Information Technology ---\\
Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX\textsuperscript{\textregistered})

- Base Definitions, Issue 6         [sometimes called XBD]
- System Interfaces, Issue 6        [sometimes called XSH]
- Shell and Utilities, Issue 6      [sometimes called XCU]
- Rationale (Informative), Issue 6  [sometimes called XRAT]

So I guess we could refer to it as:

@Book{
   IEEE01:1003.1,
   author="IEEE and Open Group, The",
   title="{IEEE} {S}td 1003.1\texttrademark{}-2001 Standard for
     Information Technology --- {P}ortable {O}perating {S}ystem
     {I}nterface ({POSIX}\textsuperscript{\textregistered})",
   publisher="IEEE and The Open Group",
   year="2001",
   edition="Issue 6",
   month=dec,
   note="Available \url{http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/toc.htm}",
   status="sighted:CLlib:ST.8.7",
   abstract="opt",
   keywords="opt",
}

and possibly we could add specific volumes to the end of the title
(Base Definitions, System Interfaces, Shell and Utilities, Rationale
(Informative)).


Interesting things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ERRORS:
- no function sets errno to zero
- errno is per thread
- implementations may add extra errors unless expressly forbidden,
  either existing error codes or new ones.  But if an error condition
  occurs that is described in the standard, the prescribed error code
  shall be used for it.
- an implicit "[EINTR] forbidden" is assumed for all functions with
  "Threads" option (THR) that don't mention EINTR explicitly.
(all from XSH2.3).
- short descriptions appear in <errno.h> entry in XBD;
  long descriptions appear in XSH2.3.

SIGNALS:
- see XSH2.4
- async-signal-safe functions listed in XSH2.4.3.

XSI STREAMS:
- POSIX specifies XSI STREAMS as well as sockets, but only as an
  option (code "XSR").  See XSH2.6.  We say no more.

THREADS:
- Threads are an option ("THR").  XSH2.9.

FILES:
- XBD3.253: a "file descriptor" (a small integer) points to an "open
  file description" (a structure that describes an open file).  Good
  terminology.

SOCKETS:
- discussed in XSH2.10.
- terminology is good.  "Connection Indication Queue" for the queue of
  completed incoming connections pending accept()ance.
- SIGURG is sent when socket is notified of OOB data, not when it
  actually arrives (which may be later).
- table of pending erros at XSH2.10.15
- desc of all POSIX SOL_SOCKET SO_* at XSH2.10.16
