POSIX

The standardized subset is part of POSIX 2001 which is available
on-line. The most convenient URL for you is probably

ANVL is a very useful tool for regression testing and checking some
edge cases.  However, calling it a formal compliance testing kit is
probably stretching things a bit.  There is no such thing as a TCP/IP
compliance test, nor, really, should there be one.  The acid test for
a TCP/IP implementation is *interoperability*, not strict compliance
with the RFCs.

IETF != ITU.

ANVL is the gold standard for protocol conformance testing, but it's
not anywhere close to free.  It seems like I've heard of another test
suite, but I can't find the information on it.

Here are two documents.  The first pertains loosely to Linux and *BSD, while
the latter explains Windows TCP implementation in detail.

I have vaguely mentioned this before, but there seems to be more to it
now and
it could be useful whilst doing TCP.
