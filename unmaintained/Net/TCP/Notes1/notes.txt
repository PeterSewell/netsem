DVD outline:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

see /usr/groups/tthee/dvd-full/ for the image and
Net/TCP/doc/dvd-full.sh for the script.

== SO FAR:

sigcomm TCP and UDP trace and check data
  - trace: trace????, trace????.html, trace????.ps.gz
  - check: join: trace????.out.html, trace????.annotated.ps.gz
  - check: contributing runs: trace????.out.html
      (annotated.ps.gz would be redundant, since it's only generated
       for successful runs)
  - foo-regression.html for each join

- the sources for FreeBSD and Linux

- the CVS tree [definitely not in public version]
  - the final tree
  - the whole repository

- HOLDoc (from s/f)


== TO ADD:

STILL HAVEN'T GENERATED successfully past trace1617 in the UDP
annotated run of sigcomm join.
Should make sure all the other things are really there; note the
missing things below.

batch data (some missing?)
   tracennnn  (TCP: 0000-2294 except 1116-1119)
   tracennnn.html (TCP: above, except trace2294.html)
   tracennnn.ps.gz  (TCP: above, except 1791,1803,1834-5,1866-7,1905-7,1916-21,1930-5,1944-9,2070)

check data (some missing?)
   tracennnn.annotated.ps.gz (none)

- the TR (ps, pdf)
- the spec, in source and (ps,pdf) forms
- the checker  [definitely not in public version]

- any other docs?

- question: is the trace data confidential or public?
    (Note too that the trace data can be extracted from the check
    data.)

- question: a _built_ repo?  (at least with all the PS docs etc)

- anything else?

K,P muse on what should be done before K evaporates (end March).


- polish up TR and spec in any way we want to:

     - fix page numbering and frontmatter format for Markus
       (P plans to keep roman numbering and Parts in spec, though)

     - go through remaining visible TODOs -  3 left for K NOW DONE

     - read and sanity-check (P has done this quickly for TR and for spec)

     - fix page lengths:
           in TR abstract - length of spec
           in TR intro - length of spec
           in TR S4 - length of spec broken down into 3 bits
           in bib - length of TR and of spec


- eyeball HOL source for any particularly embarrasing comments to make
  it releasable (under a suitable licence, to be discussed)

- pick out linux and winxip TCP trace sets and run checker on them
  once, just to see

- tidy up dataset, ensuring the BSD TCP runs, those runs, the trace
  data, _and all the generated stuff_ (including zigzags,
  rulename-annotated zigzags, etc) are all in completely backed-up
  space.

- tidy up directory structure for tools

- burn DVDs with data and tools

- braindump Keith/Peter/Matthew -> Adam



Done:

 - write talks for SRG and Semantics Lunch

 - construct join of the 4 TCP runs

    # main
    # CHECKDIR=/auto/groups/tthee-scratch/check/check-2005-02-03T17:13:56+0000

    # extra mem
    # CHECKDIR=/auto/groups/tthee-scratch/check/check-2005-02-04T12:07:26+0000/

    # crashes
    #CHECKDIR=/auto/groups/tthee-scratch/check/check-2005-02-05T21:40:53+0000

    # redo crashes
    CHECKDIR=/auto/groups/tthee-scratch/check/check-2005-02-06T15:45:33+0000


Decided not to do:

 - expand any discussion in TR that may be good for future papers

P thinks we're doing things as follows:



  Keith:

    - Spec:         try to get TCP above 90% and better timer rule coverage
    - Spec todos:   those typographical things, then it's done
    - Spec todos:   non-typographical todos
    - TR todos:     sundry labelled Keith, esp. T-T-A-G impacts
    - state diagram timer rules

  Peter:

    - TR: improve text for related work  (Postel's PhD now on order :-)
    - TR: sundry todos
    - TR: read Matthew's blue-ink
    - Paper: wait for Tim's comments
    - fix up internal references between TR and Spec and State diagram
    - put all on web

  Michael:

    - Checker: oq, long time passage, and TRANSITION questions

  Matthew:

    - do PhD.

  All:

    - Paper:  improve text
    - TR:     improve text

performance:  look at corners in timegraph. look at pure-exponential
  trace mentioned in email.

phone sync with mn:  (K possible: wed am? fri am?)

   try to fix the long-string-crash HOL problem (different representation
   type?)

   rerun UDPpayloadMax non-space-constrained

   satisfiability checking for final constraints


analysis: look at non-successes, for two reasons. 1: to have a
sentence or two for each we can include in the doc.  2: to fix
remaining low-hanging problems.

state diagram: someone to look at timer transitions

techreport: subsections for K:
  - relationship with code structure
  - network model
Related work (via library...).
Impact in t-w-a-g.
Update current check status, with
  statistics and graphs from xmas run, and with lists of reasons why the
  non-succeeds didn't.
Read through. Make better.


paper:

 Paper registration/abstract: January 30, 2005 (Required, hard deadline)
 Paper submission: February 6, 2005 (Hard deadline)
 Paper notification: April 30, 2005
 Camera-ready papers: June 3, 2005

spec:

 lots of TODOs. Many need reclassification, simply.  Some are
 important munger todos (and some are mere wishes).


------------------------------------------

Done:

runs: stop pb run.  handcraft join, taking care of crash-in-ones.  get
mktraceindex to run over the result. fix /tthee-scratch/ !!!

wrt exponentials, run loggy thing on the two.  send to mn.

tr:
  - time,
  - protocol rules

spec:
 make buildable again (wrt name collision problem)
