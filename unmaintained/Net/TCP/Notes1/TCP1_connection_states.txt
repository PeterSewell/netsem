Some quick thoughts on TCP connection states (maybe Steve can flesh
out?).

A TCP connection can be in various `modes' -- slow start, persisting,
retransmitting, etc.

We would like to identify those modes precisely, defining predicates
over our HOL model host states.  Two motivations:

- testing: these are really key aspects of TCP; we want to ensure the
  automatic testing covers all the different modes (and transitions?).

- exposition: by understanding what they are, and especially which are
  disjoint and which cover the whole state space, we'll be able to
  explain TCP better.  We might also be able to restructure the model.


Question: is a mode a property just of a single host, or of a pair of
hosts and a set of segments-in-transit?  Don't know.

Question: is a mode a property just of one direction of communication,
or of the duplex pair?  Don't know.  Guess some are one, some are the
other.

Think a mode should be an instantaneous property, not (eg) a predicate
on a subtrace.

It's perhaps enough to restrict attention in which both endpoints are
ESTABLISHED?  (many modes are also sensical in some later states, but
it would be tiresome to explore those boundaries)

So, what are the modes?
