reachable states of a pair of sockets in two (not necessarily
distinct?) machines that have dual quads and `synchronised' sequence
numbers, whatever that means (inequalities about sequence numbers to
be written down).  That means we don't have to consider pairs where
one machine has rebooted and moved into an unrelated state. (Probabilistically...)

non-reachable: EST,SST corresponds to A,S, i.e. impossible to receive a SYN and ACK it without sending SYN

now need observable differences between pairs?

identify FW1 and FW2?

identify CLOSING TIME_WAIT and LAST_ACK?
