tentatively aim for SIGCOMM07 deadline (31 Jan) (constraints: Michael
in Perth last two weeks December; Tom's scheduled interruption on 7
Jan)

look through trace set
 - select traces that exemplify stuff (and maybe write a few new ones)
 - look at Adam's mirror and make a few lossy traces (a bit later)
 - maybe aim for 100 checked traces?

polish and package abstractor

write level3 checker and package  (run by hand at first, maybe adapt the
 checking infrastructure to htmlize etc)

change form of transition relation.  consensus seemed to be to move to
  h,S,M ---l---> h',S',M' where S and M are _all_ the streams and messages
  in the network

abstraction relation and function - state a relation (just on low and high level network configurations, or low and high pairs-of-hosts-with-streams-and-messages?) explicitly, and prove (shock) that the abstraction function hits it

make sure spec3 typesets

muse on possible proofs of invariants about reachable pairs of TCPSTATEs and wire messages
