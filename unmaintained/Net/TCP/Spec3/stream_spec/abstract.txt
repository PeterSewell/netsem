Despite more then 30 years of research on protocol specification, the
major protocols deployed in the Internet, such as TCP, are described
only in informal prose RFCs and executable code.  In part this is
because the scale and complexity of these protocols makes them
challenging targets for formalization.

In this paper we show how these difficulties can be addressed.  We
develop a high-level specification for TCP and the Sockets API,
expressed in the HOL proof assistant, describing the byte-stream
service that TCP provides to users.  This complements our previous
low-level specification of the protocol internals, and makes it
possible for the first time to state what it means for TCP to be
correct: that the protocol implements the service.  We define a
precise abstraction function between the models and validate it by
testing, using verified testing infrastructure within HOL.  This is a
pragmatic alternative to full proof, providing reasonable confidence
at a relatively low entry cost.

Together with our previous validation of the low-level model, this
shows how one can rigorously tie together concrete implementations,
low-level protocol models, and specifications of the services they
claim to provide, dealing with the complexity of real-world protocols
throughout.
