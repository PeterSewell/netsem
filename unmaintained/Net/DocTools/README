make will do everything.

well, not quite: you have to do

  make
  bibtex typography
  latex typography
  latex typography
  ./domakeindex
  latex typography

and you'll be done.


(OLD ADVICE:)

In Net/DocTools say:

cat ../Sem/rules.txt | rebracket | rules_to_latex |munge > tmp-rules.tex ; latex typography


Here:

  rebracket       converts [[ and ]] to $<[ and ]>$  

  rules_to_latex  parses rule-format and spits out latex

  munge           does syntax munging, which mostly is putting font-commands 
                  around identifiers 

  typography.tex  is a latex file that defines handy macros then includes
                  tmp-rules.tex


  infer           does inference-rule munging: see documentation below.


INFER --- automatic inference-rule munging:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Infer is a filter.

It looks for blocks bracketed by lines containing the exact text
"<RULES" and "RULES>", with nothing else on the line (not even
spaces).

In fact, if the lines are "<RULES[" and "]RULES>" instead, the
behaviour is the same except that it inserts the characters "<[" and
"]>" before and after each rule-line.  This is useful for
post-munging!

Within these brackets, the contents are treated as a rectangular array
of characters.

A "rule" is a subrectangle of this array.  The filter looks for a row
of five or more `-' characters to locate a rule, and then locates the
rectangle spanned precisely by this row, and with the maximum number
of non-blank rows above and below this line.

Each rule is then typeset as

\autoinfer{\begin{array}{l}line1\\ line2\\ line3\end{array}}{\begin{array}{l}line4\\ line5\\ line6\end{array}}

in the place of the row of dashes (yes, all on one line).

Anything that is not a rule is literally passed through.

BEWARE!  Your row of dashes must be long enough, otherwise strange
effects occur.
