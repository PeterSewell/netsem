Network Semantics

This repository contains the formal specification of TCP, UDP, and the Sockets API developed in the Netsem project:

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/Netsem/index.html

The Net/ directory is based on the latest CVS version; it contains the segment- and stream-level specifications, trace checker, test generation, and testing infrastructure tools. 

The TCP-HOL4 and TCP-LEM directories are a port of the specifications to Lem.
